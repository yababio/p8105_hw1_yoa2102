## Problem 1

#### Creating a data frame

Create a data frame comprised of: a random sample of size 10 from a
standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor vector of length 10 (with 3 different factor “levels”).

``` r
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("small", "small", "small", "med", "med", "med", "med", "large", "large", "large"))
  )
```

#### Means of variables in the data frame

Take the mean of each variable in the data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1681226

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Note that R is able to take the means of the numeric and logical
vectors, but was unable to take the mean of the factor and character
vectors. In the case of the logical vector, R converted “TRUE” and
“FALSE” values to 0s and 1s before calculating a mean.

#### Converting data frame vectors to numeric

Convert the logical, character, and factor vectors in the data set to
numeric vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

R is able to convert the logical and factor vectors to numeric vectors,
but was unable to do so for the character vector. As discussed earlier,
R converted the logical vector to a numeric vector by changing “TRUE”
and “FALSE” values to 0s and 1s. In the case of the factor vector, R
assigned different numeric values (i.e. 1,2, or 3) to the different
levels of this variable.

Therefore, in order to perform a mathematical operation on a factor
vector (ex. calculating a mean), one would first need to convert the
factor vector to a numeric vector. In the case of a logical vector, R
will automatically do the appropriate conversion and therefore no
additional function (as.numeric) needs to be applied before calculating
a mean.

#### Converting data frame vectors to logical and multiplying

Convert the the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
sample by the result. Then, convert the logical vector to a factor, and
multiply the random sample by the result. Lastly, convert the logical
vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply
the random sample by the result.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ##  [1] 1.9411041 0.5528721 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.8750326 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ##  [8] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.8392662

``` r
as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)), pull(prob1_df, : '*'
    ## not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ##  [1]  3.88220824  1.10574413 -0.61789335 -1.32583812  1.75006517 -0.03853616

## Problem 2

#### Loading the data set

Load the penguins data set into R.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Describing the data set

Familiarize yourself with the penguins data set (by using ?penguins).
Describe the data set.

The penguins data set includes information (collected between 2007-2009)
about size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station,
Antarctica (at any of the following islands: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen).
The data set contains 8 columns, 344 rows, and consists of the following
variables: species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm,
flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

The mean flipper length for penguins in this data set is 200.9152047 mm
with a standard deviation of 14.0617137 mm.

The mean bill length of penguins in this data set is 43.9219298 mm with
a standard deviation of 5.4595837 mm.

The mean bill depth of penguins in this data set is 17.1511696 mm with a
standard deviation of 1.9747932 mm.

The mean body mass of penguins in this data set is 4201.754386 g with a
standard deviation of 801.9545357 g.

#### Creating a scatterplot of the data set

Create a scatterplot of the penguins data set with appropriate title,
axes, and color differentiation between species.

``` r
hw1_plot =
penguins %>% 
    ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Penguins Scatterplot") +
    xlab("Bill Length (mm)") +
    ylab("Flipper Length (mm)") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))


print(hw1_plot)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

#### Saving the scatterplot

Save a pdf of the scatterplot using ggsave.

``` r
ggsave("hw1_plot.pdf")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
